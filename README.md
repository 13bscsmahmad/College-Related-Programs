SEECSCalendarAutomation is a program that creates a timetable specifically for SEECS. The user will input all the timetable information. Saving the information will either create a new .csv file or append to an existing one, depending on whether the file exists. This .csv file can be imported into Google Calendar (or other calendars that support .csv import). Essentially,  this program aims to make it easier to create a .csv file instead of manually writing it.
NOTE: The default directory to where the .csv file will be created is hardcoded for now. It is @"C:\Users\MMA\Desktop\", and is stored in the string "path" variable.
